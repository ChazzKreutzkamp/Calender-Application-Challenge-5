# Work Day Hourly Updating Calender

This application is a simple calender that helps a user keep track of work day events.
To help keep track of events, the calender is color coded to indicate which events are currently
occuring, have occured, or will occur. In addition there are save buttons that keep events in
Local Storage and said saved events will be reloaded once the page is refreshed.
